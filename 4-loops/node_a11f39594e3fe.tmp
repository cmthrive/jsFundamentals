    - Loops offer us a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly, or loop over something

    - there are many different kinds of loops, but they all do roughly the same thing:
        - the loop will repeat until a specified condition evaluates to false

        - for loop
        - do while loop
        - while loop
        - for in
        - for of

        - for loop takes in 3 parameters and Keyword
            1. initial expression (let i = 0;)
            2. condition <10
            3. increment expression

            *** separated by semi colon

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {// i+= i + 1
console.log(i);
}

// Challenge: using a for loop, count to 20; by 2

for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i+=2)
console.log(i);

for (let i = 10; i >=0; i+=1)
console.log(i);
